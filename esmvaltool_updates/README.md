# UKESM-25-03-2020

- ESMValTool Workshop: 9-12 March, 2020:
  - Discussed the [Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGMIj69pGl3GiTOU1at2NY01blYouVX0WmHVvCXrvvs);
    - identified the collaboration with the Met Office and as such...
    - ...we have a new co-PI: Alistair "Ali" Sellar;
    - identified the need for a Steering group and three core lead groups (Technical, Scientific and User Engagement);
    - discussed the attributes of each of these groups;
  - Discussed the requirements for upcoming stable release `esmvaltool=2.0`;
- Technical paper is now [published](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/13/1179/2020/) (Yippee Ki Yay, M`****`r!);
- The other two papers: scientific-diagnostics (review ended), scientific extra-extra (somewhere in the pipes, most
  probably ending review phase);
- We have a new and improved [Documentation](https://esmvaltool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and an ever nicer
  [Website](https://www.esmvaltool.org/) with a cool [Gallery](https://www.esmvaltool.org/gallery.html);
- We started working on a dedicated [Tutorial Project](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/tutorial) aiming to
  present users with an easy to deploy and use tutorial (currently WIP);
- (``more``) Boring stuff:
  - OBS data on Jasmin: `/group_workspaces/jasmin4/esmeval` is now freed up of junk and at only 20% full, as compared to 80% previously;
  - started looking into building a docker container for `esmvaltool`;
  - Lee had been running a lot of IPCC stuff and producing plots;
